# G4 Closure Summary — Governance Workflow Integration

**Checkpoint status:** PASS / CLOSED / FROZEN (Formally approved by Lead Architect on 2026-09-14)  
**Date:** 2026-09-14  
**Branch:** `development`  

---

## 1. What Shipped

Checkpoint G4 establishes the end-to-end integration between AgentGate's persisted policy lifecycle (G3) and its live authorization decision engine (G1). For the first time, changes committed through the governance REST API directly, immediately, and safely drive live authorization evaluations:
```text
candidate -> validate -> dry-run compare -> activate -> observe changed decision -> rollback -> observe restored decision
```

G4 preserves all frozen G1 decision invariants (`decision.Request` / `decision.Result`), G2 identity and tool classification boundaries (`internal/identity`, `internal/toolregistry`, `internal/argdecl`), and G3 persistence guarantees (`internal/policystore.Store`), ensuring that policy evaluation remains fail-closed, atomic, and cryptographically traceable.

Four workstreams converged on the G4 checkpoint:

1. **W1 — Go Backend (Commits `a15fdd0`, `68b209d`, `a482e33`, `a3ce597`):**
   - `internal/auditevents`:
     - Defined `MutationEvent` contract with typed `MutationAction` constants (`activate`, `rollback`, `create_candidate`), workspace scoping, version provenance, and timestamps.
     - Defined `MutationListener` interface with zero-overhead `NewNoopListener()` and thread-safe `RecordingListener` for test assertions.
   - `internal/policymanager`:
     - Extended `Manager` with `NewWithListener(store, listener)` constructor (existing `New(store)` delegates with no-op listener, preserving 100% backward compatibility).
     - Emits `MutationEvent` on `CreateCandidate`, `Activate` (capturing previous active version), and `Rollback` (capturing rolled-back-from version).
   - `internal/governanceintegration`:
     - Created `GovernanceDecisionService` connecting `policymanager.Manager` to `decision.Engine`.
     - `EvaluateWithActivePolicy`: Evaluates requests against the currently active engine from cache, or fails closed with `ReasonNoPolicyLoaded` if no policy is active.
     - `DryRunCompare`: Evaluates sample decision requests against both the active engine and a candidate engine, returning paired outcomes with changed status and provenance, guaranteeing zero mutation of active state.
   - `internal/govapi` & `cmd/agentgate`:
     - Implemented `POST /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/policies/{version}/dryrun` endpoint converting sample payloads to typed `decision.Request`s.
     - Returns paired active and candidate decisions, reasons, versions, and `changed` flag.
     - Wired `GovernanceDecisionService` into the server runtime in `cmd/agentgate/main.go`.

2. **W2 — Frontend / UI (Commits `85afa5c`, `48d74fc`):**
   - `src/models/governance.ts`:
     - Typed domain models (`DryRunCompareResult`, `DryRunCompareResponse`, `DryRunSample`) strictly typed under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` and `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`.
   - `src/api/governanceClient.ts`:
     - Extended `GovernanceClient` interface with `dryRunCompare()`, implemented in `MockGovernanceClient` (deterministic mock comparison) and `HttpGovernanceClient` (REST caller).
   - `src/state/policyLifecycleState.ts`:
     - Extended `PolicyLifecycleState` with `dryRunResult` and `rollbackStatus` (`idle`, `rolling_back`, `confirmed`, `error`).
     - Added `store.dryRunCompare(version, samples)` proving that dry-run leaves active versions and policies untouched.
     - Enhanced `store.rollback()` to manage operation status transitions.
   - `src/view/policy-lifecycle-view.ts`:
     - Implemented display renderers `toDryRunComparisonView` (headline, before/after badges, provenance) and `toOperationStatusView` (operation status indicator).
   - 63 passing Vitest tests and clean TypeScript compilation (`tsc --noEmit`).

3. **W3 — QA / Security (Commit `fef6484`):**
   - `agentgate/qa/g4integration/integration_test.go`:
     - 8 independent end-to-end security invariant suites proving the G4 Definition of Done:
       1. **Full Lifecycle Decision Propagation**: Verified candidate -> validate -> dry-run compare -> activate -> changed live decision -> rollback -> restored live decision sequence via REST API and decision evaluation.
       2. **Dry-Run Isolation**: Verified dry-run comparisons against candidate B have zero effect on active policy version, active engine, or live evaluation.
       3. **Failed Activation Resilience**: Proved activating a nonexistent version fails with 404, leaving previous active policy intact and effective.
       4. **Immediate Cache Coherence**: Proved that immediately after activation succeeds, the cache serves the new policy with zero stale-cache window.
       5. **Multi-Workspace Isolation**: Proved policy lifecycle operations in workspace 1 have zero impact on workspace 2.
       6. **Mutation Event Correlation**: Proved all lifecycle mutations emit correctly typed and timestamped `MutationEvent`s.
       7. **Admin Auth Boundary**: Verifies that all governance endpoints strictly reject unauthenticated or invalidly authenticated requests (401 Unauthorized).
       8. **Fail Closed on Missing Policy**: Workspaces without an active policy fail closed with `ReasonNoPolicyLoaded`.
     - Zero regressions across G1 black-box, G2 security, and G3 governance suites.

4. **W4 — DevOps / Release Engineering (Commits `ed3f4d8`, `865e0e7`):**
   - `deploy/g4/docker-compose.yml`:
     - Built reproducible Docker Compose topology extending G3 with PostgreSQL 16 Alpine and AgentGate G4 container build.
     - Configured with dynamic environment interpolation for credentials (`${AGENTGATE_ADMIN_TOKEN:-...}`, `${AGENTGATE_DATABASE_URL:-...}`) with explicit non-secret development fallback fixtures for local/CI test harness.
     - Documented production invariant: production deployments must inject secrets via orchestrator/secret management and must never inherit hardcoded test fixtures.
     - Validated compose syntax via `docker compose config`.
   - `deploy/g4/README.md`:
     - Operational verification guide detailing health/readiness probe verification (`/healthz` and `/readyz`) and step-by-step curl sequence executing the full G4 lifecycle proof.
     - Explicitly documents architectural boundary: real MCP proxying remains open (O-008) and is scheduled for Gate G6.

### Key Design Decisions & Rationale

1. **Full `decision.Request` Evaluation in Dry-Run Comparator**:
   - Rather than previewing raw Cedar policy syntax via `policy.EvalInput`, `GovernanceDecisionService.DryRunCompare` evaluates complete `decision.Request` objects through `decision.NewEngineWithPolicy()`.
   - *Why*: Ensures that caller identity validation, tool classification checks, and fail-closed reason codes apply identically to dry-run previews as they do in live enforcement.

2. **Additive, Backward-Compatible Constructor in Policy Manager**:
   - `policymanager.NewWithListener(store, listener)` was added, while `policymanager.New(store)` remains as a delegate using `NewNoopListener()`.
   - *Why*: Preserves 100% backward compatibility with all G3 test fixtures and initialization code without breaking existing callers.

3. **In-Process Audit Listener Hook (`auditevents`) without Premature Durability**:
   - Defined the structured event shape and listener interface without coupling to database storage or messaging infrastructure in G4.
   - *Why*: Satisfies the 10-day plan requirement that policy mutations be auditable in G4, while keeping the concrete durable audit engine scoped to Gate G5 (O-002).

4. **Integration Test Harness Credential Management in Compose**:
   - Used environment variable interpolation (`${VARIABLE:-fallback}`) with explicit non-secret development fixtures.
   - *Why*: Enables zero-friction local development and CI testing while establishing the production invariant that production environments must inject real secrets via orchestrator secret stores.

### Trade-offs & Known Rough Edges

1. **Local In-Memory Cache**: Active policy engines are cached in-memory per AgentGate process (`sync.RWMutex`). In a multi-replica deployment, policy activations on replica A will not invalidate replica B until multi-node invalidation (PostgreSQL `LISTEN/NOTIFY` or Redis pub/sub) is added (O-007 / G8 scope).
2. **Synchronous Dry-Run Evaluation**: `DryRunCompare` evaluates sample requests sequentially in-process. For large evaluation sets (>1,000 samples), batch chunking or asynchronous evaluation jobs will be required in production.
3. **No Durable Audit Persistence Yet**: Mutation events are captured by the in-memory listener during G4 tests. Durable persistence to disk/database is G5 scope.
4. **No Real MCP Gateway Proxying**: MCP requests are evaluated against `decision.Engine` via Go test harnesses and REST endpoints. Real network-level proxying via agentgateway ext_authz is Gate G6 (O-008).

## 3. Where to Look (Code Reading List)

1. [`agentgate/internal/governanceintegration/integration.go`](file:///d:/PROJECTS/AgentGate_Hackathon/agentgate-repo/agentgate/internal/governanceintegration/integration.go): The central integration seam connecting G3 lifecycle management to G1 live decision evaluation and dry-run comparison.
2. [`agentgate/internal/auditevents/events.go`](file:///d:/PROJECTS/AgentGate_Hackathon/agentgate-repo/agentgate/internal/auditevents/events.go): The mutation event contract and listener interface serving as the G4/G5 audit hook.
3. [`agentgate/qa/g4integration/integration_test.go`](file:///d:/PROJECTS/AgentGate_Hackathon/agentgate-repo/agentgate/qa/g4integration/integration_test.go): The comprehensive, independent black-box proof suite proving the 8 G4 security and behavioral invariants.
4. [`frontend/src/state/policyLifecycleState.ts`](file:///d:/PROJECTS/AgentGate_Hackathon/agentgate-repo/frontend/src/state/policyLifecycleState.ts): The frontend store demonstrating client-side dry-run isolation and rollback status tracking.

## 4. Open Decisions Status

In accordance with `docs/DECISIONS/OPEN_DECISIONS.md`:

- **O-001 (Downstream identity/credential propagation):** Carried forward (deferred to G7).
- **O-002 (Audit durability guarantee):** **RESOLVED in G3.** G4 implements the in-process mutation event contract and audit hook (`internal/auditevents`); Gate G5 implements the concrete durable audit engine and storage.
- **O-003 (agentgateway conformance/security boundary):** Carried forward.
- **O-004 (Supported MCP revision boundary):** Carried forward.
- **O-005 (Tool identity and schema fingerprint):** Carried forward. G2 canonical SHA-256 hashing remains the current implementation.
- **O-006 (Argument authorization model):** **CLOSED in G2.** Resolved via `internal/argdecl` (per-tool typed declaration registry).
- **O-007 (AgentGate execution identity & multi-node cache):** Carried forward.
- **O-008 (ext_authz transport mapping to decision.Request):** **EXPLICITLY OPEN.** Deferred to Gate G6. Real MCP gateway proxying and network-level enforcement is NOT part of G4.

## 6. Handoff to G5

With Gate G4 completed, formally approved by the Lead Architect, and frozen across all four workstreams:
- The governance lifecycle directly and provably controls live authorization decisions.
- Dry-run comparisons allow safe pre-activation inspection without risk of state corruption.
- Policy mutations emit structured events ready for durable audit ingestion.

Next checkpoint is **Gate G5 — Durable Audit Boundary**, implementing:
- High-throughput durable audit ingestion pipeline (O-002 concrete implementation).
- Durable append-only persistence for authorization decisions and policy mutation events.
- Audit event schema, tamper-detection (hash chaining/HMAC), and correlation across execution IDs.
- Fail-closed or durable-before-response enforcement guarantees.
