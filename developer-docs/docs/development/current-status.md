# Current Status

> ⚠️ **Source-of-truth note.** The repo's own
> [`docs/DEVELOPMENT/CURRENT_STATUS.md`](https://github.com/rushi-dynmsh/agentgate-dev/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPMENT/CURRENT_STATUS.md)
> is the canonical living status document. At the time this page was written it
> having been updated past 2026-09-12 (it still says "G2 not yet started"),
> while the git history shows G2 through G5 all closed. Where they
> disagree, **git history + the checkpoint closure summaries are the ground
> truth**. This page reflects that ground truth.

## Verified timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 2026-08-22 | Repo bootstrap, CI baseline, AI development workflow, Phase-0/1 planning. |
| 2026-09-07 → 09-09 | Go module scaffold + CI; Day-1 (production invariants) + Day-2 (decision core) tasks. |
| 2026-09-11 → 09-12 | **G1 - Authorization Contract Freeze: PASS/CLOSED** (all five workstreams merged; corrective closeout applied; `decision.Request`/`Result` frozen). |
| 2026-09-13 | **G2 - Identity + Tool Governance boundary: closed** (claims mapper, tool registry, arg declarations, context assembly, gateway evidence, QA suite). O-006 resolved. |
| 2026-09-13 | **G3 - Policy persistence + governance API: closed** (policystore + postgres, lifecycle manager, govapi, frontend governance client/state, QA suite). |
| 2026-09-14 | **G4 - Governance workflow integration: PASS/CLOSED/FROZEN** (formally approved by the Lead Architect 2026-09-14). Mutation audit events, governance→decision integration, dry-run compare endpoint + frontend models/views, QA proof suite (8 DoD invariants), E2E compose topology. |
| 2026-09-14 | **G5 - Durable Audit Boundary: PASS/CLOSED/FROZEN** (formally approved by the Lead Architect 2026-09-14). Durable append-only `audit_events` persistence (Postgres), append-only + tamper-evident SHA-256 row chaining with independent `ChainVerifier`, pre-persistence argument redaction, fail-closed enforcement, immutable RBAC role separation + DB immutability trigger. O-002 resolved. QA proof suite (9 DoD invariants). |
| next | **G6 - Real MCP end-to-end enforcement** (O-008 concrete implementation: wire durable audit into real gateway/MCP enforcement; real-binary MCP E2E gate). |

The active strategy is the
[10-day parallel plan](https://github.com/rushi-dynmsh/agentgate-dev/blob/main/docs/PHASES/AGENTGATE_V1_10_DAY_PARALLEL_TEAM_EXECUTION_PLAN.md),
whose gates progress G1 → G9.

## What exists and runs today

**Go backend (`agentgate/`)**
- Production service `cmd/agentgate` (config, JSON logging, health/readiness,
  graceful shutdown).
- Frozen decision core (Cedar) + test-only mock `cmd/g1-mock-authz`.
- Identity mapper, tool registry (fingerprint/drift), arg declaration registry,
  context assembler.
- Versioned policy store (memory + Postgres, atomic activation), lifecycle
  manager, admin-authenticated governance REST API, dry-run compare, mutation
  audit events.
- **Durable audit boundary (G5):** durable `internal/audit` ingestion +
  append-only Postgres `audit_events` persistence, tamper-evident SHA-256 row
  chaining + independent `ChainVerifier`, pre-persistence argument redaction
  (full/hash/omit + sensitive-key overrides), fail-closed enforcement
  (O-002 resolved).

**Gateway (`gateway/`)** — reviewable `agentgateway` config + independent Go
harness proving the wire contract against the mock, with real-binary
verification evidence.

**Frontend (`frontend/`)** — framework-agnostic typed contract layer
(models/client/state/views, Vitest coverage) for the governance workflow,
including G4 dry-run compare + rollback additions.

**Deploy (`deploy/`)** — g3 (reproducible Postgres + readiness probe + migration
verification script) and g4 (integrated governance-to-decision E2E topology)
are the currently verified environments.

**QA (`agentgate/qa/`)** — four independent suites: g1blackbox (out-of-process
contract), g2security (identity/tool/argument abuse), g3governance (lifecycle
invariants incl. Postgres), g4integration (full governance-to-decision loop).

## Not yet built (the next boundaries)

- Production `ext_authz` gRPC service (`internal/authz` placeholder) — the
  O-008 transport-mapping gap.
- Real MCP end-to-end enforcement (G6 gate).
- Downstream credential mechanism (O-001).
- A shipped UI application (frontend is the contract layer only; UI framework is
  an open decision).

## Known documentation tensions (flagged, not resolved here)

- `deploy/g1/*` files state the G1 compose topology was "written but never run",
  while `docs/PHASES/G1_WORKSTREAMS/CLOSURE_SUMMARY.md` and the stale
  `CURRENT_STATUS.md` claim it was built and verified against a real Docker
  daemon. The authoritative G1 evidence is
  [`DEVOPS_G1_ENVIRONMENT.md`](https://github.com/rushi-dynmsh/agentgate-dev/blob/main/docs/PHASES/G1_WORKSTREAMS/DEVOPS_G1_ENVIRONMENT.md),
  which documents a **direct-process** smoke test as the substitute. Treat the
  g1 container path as unverified.

## Blockers

None active. Next checkpoint **G6 - Real MCP end-to-end enforcement** is
defined (`docs/PHASES/G5_WORKSTREAMS/CLOSURE_SUMMARY.md` §8 Handoff). Open
architectural questions remain — see [Open decisions](./open-decisions.md).
